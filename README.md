mspec-test-generator
====================
A C# test generator for the MSpec test framework(https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications). 

This project will define a high level grammar that one can use to write tests with.

The primary aim of this project is to reduce the amount of boilerplate code one has to produce when writing tests.
